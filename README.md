<br>
This project modifies an existing [LSTM-based model architecture](https://github.com/SudharshanShanmugasundaram/Music-Generation.git) designed to generate piano music and changes the architecture to use an RWKV model over the LSTM. <br>
The architecture comparison is based on the validation loss achieved and the quality of the music they generate.

## Project Overview

TL;DR - This project modifies an existing [LSTM-based model architecture](https://github.com/SudharshanShanmugasundaram/Music-Generation.git)  designed to generate piano music and changes the architecture to use an RWKV model over the LSTM. The RWKV model achieved better validation loss, and the generated music sounds better (at least to us:wink:).
